CURRENT STATE OF WEBSITE:
There are 3 tabs in the menu - home, catalog, shopping bag.
Also the registration is available.

Once you register/login, you will be able to add products to the shopping bag.
If you login as an admin, the 4th tab appears - users. For now the only feature there
is a list o all users of the website (those, who ever registered), but later I plan to
add several other features such as reviewing purchases history of every user and adding 
new products/ deleting existing ones.

As for the casual users, they can use the catalog, add products to the shopping bag,
see through all the elements in the shopping bag. I am planning to add an option of 
adding several products of the same type at once in the catalog (+\- button regulating 
the quantity of produts, that need to be added to the shopping bag).

Also Shopping bag need to be developed and finalized - I need to add the possibility to 
actually buy the products from the bag and delete/change amount of the products from
the shopping bag.

Moreover, I definetely need to add pages of every product with information about them.

After adding all the features described above I can also make the Home tab more intersting,
since now it`s almost empty.
