CURRENT STATE OF WEBSITE:
I added registration form (standard one, from laravel auth),
The registration is working and registered users are added to DB.
User can also log out.
All of the sections and routes are working, except for login.
It also does not appear on most of the pages (views).
It can only be seen in the registration view.
